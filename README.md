# Light-up Chessboard Project
This project is for an interactive light up chessboard made for the advanced microcontroller class ECE 4951 at University of Michigan-Dearborn. The file labeled "Arduino Code" is the code used to control the input/output of LEDs and sensor voltage using the Arduino mega board, and was used to demo the project. 

The file "legal moves" contains the legalmoves class that can be used on the chessboard to display the legal moves for each piece
The file "Project" contains the full set of code with the legalmoves class, which includes classes that check for changes on the board (when a piece is picked up) and displays LEDs to teach the player what moves can be made for each piece.
